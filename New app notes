Steps to create new Angular2/Node app:

Follow along with Angular's quickstart guide: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

To launch: ng serve --open (from the project's directory)

To add a component: ng generate component componentName

To edit a component: edit the .ts file to write JS/Angular, edit the html file to affect change

To link to a new page: Import the component to in app-routing.module.ts
Add the path and component reference to the routes array

Any HTML in app.component.html is meant to be constant for every page
<router-element></router-element> is where a routed page will display

index.html is where I define metadata for the entire application
